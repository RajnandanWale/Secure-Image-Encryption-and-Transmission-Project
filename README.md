# Secure Image Encryption and Transmission

## Overview

The **Secure Image Encryption and Transmission** project is a robust, open-source solution for encrypting digital images and securely transmitting them over networks. Designed to protect sensitive visual data—such as medical images, personal photos, or proprietary designs—this project ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity during storage and transfer. By leveraging industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and efficient image processing, it provides a flexible framework for developers, researchers, and privacy-conscious users.

The project supports popular image formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP) and uses **AES-256** for symmetric encryption, with optional **RSA** for secure key exchange. Images can be transmitted securely via TCP sockets or HTTP/HTTPS protocols, with built-in integrity checks to prevent tampering. Whether you're building secure communication tools, handling sensitive data, or exploring cryptography, this project offers a reliable and extensible platform.

## Features

- **Robust Encryption**:
  - Implements **AES-256** in CBC mode for fast, secure symmetric encryption of image data.
  - Optional **RSA** (2048-bit) for secure key exchange or hybrid encryption.
- **Image Processing**:
  - Supports multiple formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc.) using **Pillow** or **OpenCV**.
  - Efficiently processes images for encryption without quality loss.
- **Secure Transmission**:
  - Transmits encrypted images over TCP sockets or HTTP/HTTPS with end-to-end encryption.
  - Includes integrity verification using SHA-256 hashes.
- **Key Management**:
  - Securely generates and stores encryption keys.
  - Supports both manual key input and automated key generation.
- **Decryption and Verification**:
  - Decrypts images to their original format with proper key authentication.
  - Verifies image integrity to ensure no tampering during transmission.
- **Cross-Platform**:
  - Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Extensible**:
  - Modular design allows integration with custom protocols or additional encryption algorithms.

## Motivation

In today’s digital landscape, protecting sensitive visual data is critical. Unsecured image sharing can lead to data breaches, privacy violations, or intellectual property theft. This project addresses these challenges by providing:
- A lightweight, open-source tool for secure image encryption and transmission.
- Compliance with cryptographic best practices (e.g., NIST standards).
- A user-friendly interface for developers and end-users.
- A foundation for secure applications in healthcare, enterprise, or personal use cases.
